# sql-mvc-c9install

**Getting started with SQL-MVC on the cloud9 IDE:**


Open this link in a new window or tab: https://c9.io/open/git/?url=git://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9.git

If you don't yet have a cloud 9 account it will allow you to create a free one.


Once Could 9 has loaded right click on "run-cloud9.sh" in the file tree and say run.

![run-cloud9.sh](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_01.png "run-cloud9.sh")

As it runs, installer will prompt a few times, just press enter.

Once done, on the menu click preview ... preview with webserver, or follow the
instructions to open the URL in a new browser window.
To get the application URL, click on "Share" on the top right.

![Click share](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_share_1.png "Click share")

And note the application URL in the dialogue box:

![Check the Application URL and where it if you wish](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_share_2.png "URL")



Now you will see the application run - exactly the same as the sql-mvc.com site.

**note for size constrained screens the green strawberry acts as a menu activator**

To play around, go to the directory tree, navigate to demo-app/Quale/Standard/Home/Guest/MainMenu/02_demos/10_todo_mvc.quicc

![and Edit](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_edit_1.png "Edit")

edit this file, and after the **<#view** line add 

> warning this is just the start

then save with *ctrl-s*, within a few seconds you will notice the file compiling in the console
and then your web browser will automatically reload the page with the change.
