# sql-mvc-c9install

**Getting started with SQL-MVC on the cloud9 IDE:**


Open this link in a new window or tab: https://c9.io/open/git/?url=git://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9.git

If you don't yet have a cloud 9 account it will allow you to create a free one.


Once Could 9 has loaded right click on "run-sql-mvc.sh" in the file tree and say run.

![run-sql-mvc.sh](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_01.png "run-sql-mvc.sh")

As it runs, the installer will prompt a few times, just press enter.

Sorry but cloud 9 IDE VPS's are quite slow, so please be patient with the operation.

After a few minutes, once done, you can do a preview by clicking : "Preview -- Preview with Web Server", on the menu.

Now you will see the application run in an embedded window. If the window is small, you may only see the menu,
 for size constrained screens the green strawberry acts to show or hide the menu.

To view the app in your own browser click the ![popout icon](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_popout_icon.png "popout") in the browser:

![popout in the browser](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_popout.png "popout") 


Alternatively, you need to get the URL by clicking on "Share" on the top right.

![Click share](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_share_1.png "Click share")

Copy (type) the application URL from the dialogue box to your browser:

![Check the Application URL and where it if you wish](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_share_2.png "URL")


Now you will see the application run in your browser - exactly the same as the sql-mvc.com site.



To play around, edit the files Index.quicc, TodoController.quicc,TodoModel.quicc  (short-cuts will be placed in the workspace root, during the install)

![and Edit](https://github.com/quale-quest/sql-mvc-c9/blob/master/doc/c9/c9_edit_1.png "Edit")

edit this file, and after the **<#view** line add 

> warning this is just the start

then save with *ctrl-s*, within a few seconds you will notice the file compiling in the console
and then your web browser will automatically reload the page with the change.

**Note: If you get "connect error" running the app after you disconnected from c9 for a while, then delete the project from your c9 dashboard and reinstall**
